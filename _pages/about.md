* Ankur Mali is an assistant professor in the department of computer science and engineering at the University of South Florida. He was awarded Ph.D. in Informatics at Pennsylvania State University in 2022, under [Dr. Lee Giles](https://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/). Before this, he worked in industry and obtained a bachelor's in Computer Engineering from the University of Pune, India in 2013.

At USF, he is the founder and scientific director of the Trustworthy knowledge-driven AI (TKAI) lab (website coming soon).

# Research Interest

* Formal methods meet AI: My work is at the intersection of language, memory, and computationâ€”spanning Natural Language Processing (NLP), linguistics, and formal language theory. In particular, I design knowledge-guided interpretable deep learning systems focused on generating trustworthy information. Furthermore, I am also interested in investigating the mysterious success of deep learning in recognizing natural language from a theoretical and empirical perspective.

* Predictive coding-inspired Neural architectures: Our lab, in collaboration with [NAC](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~ago/nac_lab.html), works on designing learning algorithms and computational architectures guided by theories of the brain and its functionality that emphasize solving challenges such as continual/lifelong learning, learning with minimal supervision, RL, and sparsity (both in computer vision and natural language processing).

* Low Resource and Robust NLP: In collaboration with our collaborator at the [University of Mississippi](https://lethaiq.github.io/tql3/), our lab is working on low-resource NLP to generate safe and robust AI models for the under-represented group.

* ![#1589F0](https://via.placeholder.com/15/1589F0/1589F0.png) 'Job Opening:' I am looking for a new Ph.D. student to begin in Spring/Fall 2023. All emails should have the title: Ph.D. Spring/Fall 2023. In brief words, Please provide details about why you wish to join our lab and what topics you wish to work on/explore.
* Students at USF interested in doing an Independent Study or Master's thesis (seeking me as advisor) should also provide all the details highlighted above.
