* I am a second year Ph.D. student in the [Informatics](https://ist.psu.edu/) at [Pennsylvania state university](https://www.psu.edu/), advised by Dr. [lee Giles](https://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/) and Dr. [Alexander G. Ororbia II](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~ago/). [[Curriculum Vitae](http://ankurmali/files/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf)] [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=ogxlzgcAAAAJ&hl=en)].
* My research interests lie in designing neural memory models for neural state machines and also designing models on Lifelong machine learning (LML), also referred to as never-ending learning, lifelong learning, and continual learning.
  * I also enjoy working on Biologically-inspired learning algorithm ,statistical learning procedures such as multi-modal learning and Reinforcement learning.
  * Artificial neural networks:
    ** Convolution neural network , Recurrent networks, neural memory models, Graph Neural Network.
    ** Probabilistic models and variational autoencoders.
