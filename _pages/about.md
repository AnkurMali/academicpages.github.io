* I am a second year [Informatics](https://ist.psu.edu/) Ph.D. student at [Pennsylvania state university](https://www.psu.edu/), advised by Dr. [lee Giles](https://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/) and Dr. [Alexander G. Ororbia II](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~ago/). [[Curriculum Vitae](http://ankurmali.github.io/files/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf)] [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=ogxlzgcAAAAJ&hl=en)].
* My research interests includes: designing neural memory models/neural state machines, designing models on Lifelong machine learning (LML), also referred to as never-ending learning, lifelong learning, and continual learning.
  * I develop learning algorithms that are biologically-inspired, with a strong interest in multi-modal learning and reinforcement learning
  * I engineer applications that integrate convolutional networks, recurrent networks and probabilistic models (variational autoencoders)
