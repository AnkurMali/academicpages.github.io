* Ankur Mali is an **Assistant Professor** in the department of computer science and engineering at the [University of South Florida](https://www.usf.edu/). He was awarded Ph.D. in Informatics at Pennsylvania State University in 2022, under [Dr. Lee Giles](https://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/). Before this, he worked in industry and obtained a bachelor's in Computer Engineering from the University of Pune, India in 2013.

* At USF, he is the founder and scientific director of the Trustworthy knowledge-driven AI (**TKAI**) lab (website coming soon).

# Research Interest

  * **Formal method meet AI**: My work is at the intersection of language, memory, and computationâ€”spanning Natural Language Processing (NLP), linguistics, and formal language theory. In particular, I design knowledge-guided interpretable deep learning systems focused on generating trustworthy information. Furthermore, I am also interested in investigating the mysterious success of deep learning in recognizing natural language from a theoretical and empirical perspective.

  * **Predictive coding-inspired Neural Architectures**: Our lab, in collaboration with [NAC](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~ago/nac_lab.html), works on designing learning algorithms and computational architectures guided by theories of the brain and its functionality that emphasize solving challenges such as continual/lifelong learning, learning with minimal supervision, RL, and sparsity (both in computer vision and natural language processing).

  * **Low Resource and Robust NLP**: In collaboration with our collaborator at the [University of Mississippi](https://lethaiq.github.io/tql3/), our lab is working on low-resource NLP to generate safe and robust AI models for the under-represented group.


## Notes to Prospective Students:
  * **Job Opening**: I am looking for a new Ph.D. student to begin in Spring/Fall 2023. All emails should have the title: Ph.D. Spring/Fall 2023. In brief words, Please provide details about why you wish to join our lab and what topics you wish to work on/explore.
  * Students at USF interested in doing an Independent Study or Master's thesis (seeking me as advisor) should also provide all the details highlighted above.
