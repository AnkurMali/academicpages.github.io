* I am a final year [Informatics](https://ist.psu.edu/) Ph.D. student at [Pennsylvania state university](https://www.psu.edu/), advised by Dr. [Lee Giles](https://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/) and mentored by Dr. [Alexander G. Ororbia II](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~ago/) and Dr. [Daniel Kifer](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~duk17/). I am a lab member of both the Intelligent Information Systems ([IIS](http://iis.ist.psu.edu/)) and the Neural Adaptive Computing ([NAC](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~ago/nac_lab.html)) laboratories. [[Curriculum Vitae](http://ankurmali.github.io/files/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf)] [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=ogxlzgcAAAAJ&hl=en)].
* My research interests includes: formal language theory, designing neural memory models/neural state machines, Tensor models, designing models for lifelong machine learning (LML), also referred to as never-ending learning, lifelong learning, and continual learning.
  * I develop learning algorithms that are biologically-inspired, with a strong interest in multi-modal learning and reinforcement learning
  * I design approaches that integrates convolutional networks, recurrent networks, graph and tree networks and also probabilistic models (variational autoencoders)
